**Draft of abstract:**

After industry-wide setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline industry is experiencing a strong recovery in profitability. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines worldwide have seen improved projections since 2024. The market is projected to showcase an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2029) of 4.36%, resulting in a projected market volume of US\$771.26bn by 2029, worldwide (Statista, 2024). However, low-cost carriers (LCCs) are shifting the traditional perceptions of value and service among travelers by offering lower fares with fewer amenities. As traditional full-service airlines compete in this market environment, understanding the main drivers of customer satisfaction becomes critical to maintain competitiveness.

In this research, we analyze data from over 120,000+ airline passengers, including information on passenger demographics, flight characteristics (delays and distance), as well as service evaluations. Since this data lacks information on the specific airlines and ticket pricing, we will focus on analyzing the service-related factors that universally impact passenger satisfaction. This research aims to:

1.  **Predict whether future customer would be satisfied given the details of service**
2.  **Determine the aspects of service that are important towards customer satisfaction**

In our analysis, we initially explore the dataset to understand the variables and their distributions, as well as detect missing values. Data preparation procedures such as cleaning, normalization, and transformation are conducted before analysis. We utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality as well as to determine key variables. Clustering is then implemented to gain deeper insights on passenger groups and patterns of service satisfaction.**\<- placeholder aja, bisa diubah**

## Workflow: Machine-Learning Task Translation <a name="1.5"></a>

The business analysis focuses on what key parameters from passengers' perspective that define their satisfactory level towards airline services. The analysis will be conducted by perfroming predictive modelling (regression analysis) as well as classification. Run code belows to see the workflow of the analysis.

## Reflection and Limitation <a name="1.6"></a>

In this research, we aim to predict **whether future customer would be satisfied given the details of service** by determining **the aspects of service that are important towards customer satisfaction.** From the dataset, we hypothesize that service characteristics such as arrival and departure delays, on-board service, and comfort play a significant role towards customer satisfaction.

Given that the dataset does not provide information on the specific airline or ticket pricing, we will focus to analyzing the service-related factors that universally impact passenger satisfaction. Understanding and preparing the the dataset will be crucial, as it may contain missing values or quality issues. Hence, we will dedicate the next section on data exploration and preparation. In doing so, we will first visualize the variables to get an understanding of the distributions.

# Data Exploration and Preparation <a name="2"></a>

Lorem Ipsum

## Data Cleaning and Preparation <a name="2.1"></a>

Lorem Ipsum

```{r}
any(is.na(data))
colMeans(is.na(data))
```

Null only exist for 0.3% and only in column Arrival Delay, therefore this would not significantly affecting the whole dataset. We'll fill the Arrival Delay null with mean and median of Arrival Delay whic is 0.

```{r}
data$Departure.Delay = as.numeric(data$Departure.Delay)
data$Arrival.Delay[is.na(data$Arrival.Delay)] <-0
any(is.na(data))
```

We succesfully eliminate null value in the dataset.

Lorem Ipsum \## Data Exploration <a name="2.2"></a>

Now we visualize the distribution in each categorical column

```{r}
plot_bar(data, ncol=2, order_bar=TRUE, ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

We can notice that the gender distribution is equal. The type of travel is focusing on business with most of the customer are the returning customer rather than the first time. We can notice that focus in increasing satisfaction of loyal customer will bring significant impact to the overall of airline customer satisfaction rate.

Next we will visualize the distribution in each numerical column

```{r}
plot_histogram(data, ncol=2,ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

We notice that there is some outliers in the Arrival Delay, Departure Delay, and the Flight Distance. Let's see in the boxplot format :

Flight Distance

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=Flight.Distance)) +
geom_boxplot(fill = 2,alpha = 0.5,color = 1,outlier.colour = 2) +
theme_bw()
```

Departure Delay :

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=Departure.Delay)) +
geom_boxplot(fill = 2,alpha = 0.5,color = 1,outlier.colour = 2) +
theme_bw()
```

Arrival Delay :

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=Arrival.Delay)) +
geom_boxplot(fill = 2,alpha = 0.5,color = 1,outlier.colour = 2) +
theme_bw()
```

Median imputation is appropriate when the distribution of the data is skewed.

```{r}
data$Flight.Distance[data$Flight.Distance %in% boxplot(data$Flight.Distance)$out] = median(data$Flight.Distance)
data$Arrival.Delay[data$Arrival.Delay %in% boxplot(data$Arrival.Delay)$out] = median(data$Arrival.Delay)
data$Departure.Delay[data$Departure.Delay %in% boxplot(data$Departure.Delay)$out] = median(data$Departure.Delay)
```

## Feature Engineering <a name="2.3"></a>

We notice that the age distribution have high variation, therefore we try to create the age_group column

```{r}
data = data %>% mutate(Age_Range = if_else(Age <= 16,"Children",
if_else(17 <= Age & Age <= 30,"Youth",
if_else(30 < Age & Age <= 45,"Middle Aged","Old"))))
```

```{r}
plot_bar(data$Age_Range,ncol=2,order_bar=T,ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

Now we can interpret from the age group that the largest segment of our customer is belong to old age group which is \>45 years old.

Another data we can group is the flight distance which currently right skewed

```{r}
data = data %>% mutate(Distance_Group = if_else(Flight.Distance < 1000,"Below 1000",
if_else(1000 <= Flight.Distance & Flight.Distance <= 2000,"1000-2000",
if_else(2000 < Flight.Distance & Flight.Distance < 3000,"2000-3000",
if_else(3000 < Flight.Distance & Flight.Distance < 4000,"3000-4000","Above 4000")))))
```

```{r}
plot_bar(data$Distance_Group,ncol=2,order_bar=T,ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

Our target is the satisfaction rate of the airlines services, therefore we need to identified how each variable are correlated to the satisfaction

```{r}
plot_bar(data,by='Satisfaction',ncol=2)
```

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Class, Satisfaction) %>% summarize(num=n()) %>% mutate(percentage=round(num*100/sum(num),2))
```

We notice that economy class passenger is having high customer base but with high percentage of dissatisfied customer rate. Therefore targeting this customer base for services improvement will highly affecting airline overall satisfaction rate.

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Type.of.Travel, Satisfaction) %>%
summarize(num=n()) %>%
mutate(percentage=round(num*100/sum(num),2))
```

Personal type of travel passenger is having a third of airline total customer with the number of satisfied customer is only 10% from it. Therefore it is also important customer segment to be improved.

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Customer.Type, Satisfaction) %>%
summarize(num=n()) %>%
mutate(percentage=round(num*100/sum(num),2))
```

76% of first time customer are feels dissatisfied with the airline services, this could be a problem because in the long term it will reducing airlines capability in increasing customer retention.

```{r}
data %>% filter(Customer.Type == 'First-time') %>% group_by(Class ,Satisfaction) %>%
summarize(num=n()) %>%
mutate(percentage=round(num*100/sum(num),2))
```

Most of the first-time customer feel dissatisfied in every class with notably higher in business and economy class.

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Distance_Group) %>%
summarize(num=n()) %>%
mutate(percentage=round(num*100/sum(num),2))
```

Based on the satisfaction rate in each of the distance group, we can notice that as the distance lower the rate of disatisfied customer is increasing. This become a problem because 60% of the airline customer is having journey below 1000.

Next we will try to analyze the service factors related to the customer satisfaction, starting with customer type :

```{r}

# Compute mean for each continuous column
filtered_data <- data %>% filter(Customer.Type == 'First-time') 
filtered_data <- subset(filtered_data, select = -c(ID, Flight.Distance, Age, Arrival.Delay, Departure.Delay))

mean_values <- sapply(filtered_data, function(x) if(is.numeric(x)) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) else NA)
mean_values <- na.omit(mean_values)  

mean_df <- data.frame(Variable = names(mean_values), Mean = mean_values)

# Remove NA values (non-numeric columns)
# Sort in descending order
mean_df <- mean_df[order(mean_df$Mean, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Plot bar chart with highest value on top and number labels
ggplot(mean_df, aes(x = reorder(Variable, Mean), y = Mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Mean, 2)), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mean of Continuous Variables", x = "Variable", y = "Mean Value")
```

We can identify that from the first time customer, the services that dissapointing them most in Departure and Arrival Time Convenience, Ease of Online Booking, and Wifi Service.

```{r}

# Compute mean for each continuous column
filtered_data <- data %>% filter(Type.of.Travel == 'Business') 
filtered_data <- subset(filtered_data, select = -c(ID, Flight.Distance, Age, Arrival.Delay, Departure.Delay))

mean_values <- sapply(filtered_data, function(x) if(is.numeric(x)) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) else NA)
mean_values <- na.omit(mean_values)  

mean_df <- data.frame(Variable = names(mean_values), Mean = mean_values)

# Remove NA values (non-numeric columns)
# Sort in descending order
mean_df <- mean_df[order(mean_df$Mean, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Plot bar chart with highest value on top and number labels
ggplot(mean_df, aes(x = reorder(Variable, Mean), y = Mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Mean, 2)), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mean of Continuous Variables", x = "Variable", y = "Mean Value")
```

We can identify that from the Personal type of travel customers, the services that dissapointing them most in Departure and Arrival Time Convenience, Ease of Online Booking, and Wifi Service.

```{r}

# Compute mean for each continuous column
filtered_data <- data %>% filter(Class == 'Economy') 
filtered_data <- subset(filtered_data, select = -c(ID, Flight.Distance, Age, Arrival.Delay, Departure.Delay))

mean_values <- sapply(filtered_data, function(x) if(is.numeric(x)) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) else NA)
mean_values <- na.omit(mean_values)  

mean_df <- data.frame(Variable = names(mean_values), Mean = mean_values)

# Remove NA values (non-numeric columns)
# Sort in descending order
mean_df <- mean_df[order(mean_df$Mean, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# Plot bar chart with highest value on top and number labels
ggplot(mean_df, aes(x = reorder(Variable, Mean), y = Mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Mean, 2)), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mean of Continuous Variables", x = "Variable", y = "Mean Value")
```

We can identify that from the Economy class customers, the services that dissapointing them most in Online Boarding, Ease of Online Booking, and Wifi Service.
